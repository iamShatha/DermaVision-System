# DermaVision-System
Software engineering project: AI-powered system using deep learning and computer vision to analyze skin conditions and recommend skincare products.

AI-Powered Beauty App

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project delivers an AI-powered beauty application that leverages deep learning and computer vision to analyze skin conditions and recommend suitable skincare products.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements Gathering
	â€¢	Collected requirements using questionnaires and prototyping.
	â€¢	Applied Agile methodology:
	â€¢	Created user stories and translated them into functional and non-functional requirements.

ðŸ›  Design & Architecture
	â€¢	UML Diagrams:
	â€¢	Use Case Diagram
	â€¢	Class Diagram
	â€¢	Sequence Diagram
	â€¢	State Diagram
	â€¢	Architecture Style: MVC (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller)
	â€¢	Model: AI processing & image analysis.
	â€¢	View: User interface.
	â€¢	Controller: Connects UI with AI logic.

ðŸŽ¯ Design Patterns Used
	â€¢	Abstract Factory â€“ Create related objects without specifying classes.
	â€¢	Builder â€“ Construct complex objects step-by-step.
	â€¢	Container â€“ Manage components and dependencies.
	â€¢	Chain of Responsibility â€“ Process requests through multiple handlers.
	â€¢	Adapter â€“ Bridge incompatible interfaces.
	â€¢	Command â€“ Encapsulate requests as objects.

âš™ Workflow
	1.	User captures or uploads a skin image.
	2.	AI model processes the image using deep learning algorithms.
	3.	Skin condition is analyzed and classified.
	4.	The system recommends suitable skincare products.
	5.	Results are displayed in the appâ€™s user interface.

ðŸš€ Methodology
	â€¢	Followed Agile techniques with iterative development.
	â€¢	Regular feedback cycles to refine requirements and enhance accuracy.
